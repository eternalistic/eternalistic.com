<h1>Jeremy Caldwell</h1>

<p class="intro">I'm a freelance front-end developer who specializes in Drupal theming, site development, and UX. Located in Spokane, WA.</p>

<p class="intro">I've been working with Drupal since version 4.7 (2006) and have been designing and developing for the web since 1998. My experience in design helps bring a different approach to development and accounts for user experience along the way. This ensures the project is easy to use and allows for future development and makes for a better project all around.</p>

<p class="intro">I stay current on new technologies and strive to incorporate new development tools and best practices into my workflow and share what I've learned with others.</p>
