I enjoy working on complex projects that allow me to think outside of the box and provide solutions and workflows which improve the usability of the site for both admins and users alike. If you have a similar project I'd [love to hear from you](/contact).

**Previous clients include:** Syfy, Netflix, Linux Foundation, Annenberg Foundation, and Dell.

<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote>Jeremy is one of those developers you just wish you could clone! He is a skilled coder. He follows process to the letter and is fully accountable as a distributed team member. He makes thoughtful suggestions, asks useful questions and stays on task no matter what is going on around him. He also communicates well with clients when necessary. All in all I would enthusiastically recommend him for his no nonsense, low-drama, high results style. Any dev team would be lucky to have him. I would work with him again in a heartbeat.

<blockquote>Jeremy just flat out gets the job done. His work is top notch, he's reliable, and he knows his stuff inside and out. I wouldn't hesitate to hire him to Drupal themeing, front end development, or writing other code.

<blockquote>
  Jeremy is a wonderful developer to work with, especially if you are on a tight deadline and need expert service. In addition to being incredibly competent and delivering high quality work, Jeremy has exceptional communication skills, which is important when jumping into an established development team. He was incredibly responsive in his communications, and was able to deliver when he said he would. I have worked with Jeremy on several projects and look forward to working with him again...
